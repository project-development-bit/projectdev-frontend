# Theme Navigation Reset Fix

## Issue Description
When users switched between light and dark themes using the theme switcher, the app would reset to the initial route instead of preserving the current navigation state. This created a poor user experience where theme changes would unexpectedly take users away from their current screen.

## Root Cause Analysis
The problem was in the `MyApp` widget in `main_common.dart`:

1. The `MyApp` widget was watching `themeProvider`, causing it to rebuild when the theme changed
2. On rebuild, it was calling `ref.read(routerProvider).routerConfig` which created a **new** `GoRouter` instance
3. When `MaterialApp.router` received a new `GoRouter` instance, it lost all current navigation state and reset to the initial route

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Created Persistent Router Provider
In `lib/routing/app_router.dart`, added a new provider that creates the router instance only once:

```dart
// GoRouter provider - persistent across theme changes
final goRouterProvider = Provider<GoRouter>(
  (ref) {
    final routes = ref.read(routerProvider);
    return routes.routerConfig;
  },
);
```

### 2. Updated Main App to Use Persistent Router
In `lib/main_common.dart`, changed from dynamic router creation to persistent router:

```dart
// Before (caused navigation reset)
routerConfig: ref.read(routerProvider).routerConfig,

// After (preserves navigation state)
routerConfig: ref.read(goRouterProvider),
```

## How the Fix Works

1. **Single Router Instance**: The `goRouterProvider` creates the `GoRouter` instance only once during app initialization
2. **Theme Independence**: Theme changes no longer trigger router recreation since we're using `ref.read()` instead of `ref.watch()` for the router
3. **State Preservation**: Since the same `GoRouter` instance is maintained, all navigation state (current route, route history, etc.) is preserved across theme changes

## Benefits

- ✅ Theme switching now preserves current navigation state
- ✅ Users stay on the same screen when changing themes
- ✅ Navigation history is maintained across theme changes
- ✅ Improved user experience with no unexpected route changes
- ✅ Router performance is improved (no unnecessary recreations)

## Technical Details

- **Provider Type**: Used `Provider<GoRouter>` instead of `StateNotifierProvider` since router configuration is immutable
- **Access Pattern**: Used `ref.read()` to prevent rebuilds when theme changes
- **Scope**: Fix applies to all flavors (dev, staging, production)

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to any screen in the app (e.g., login, signup, profile)
2. Change the theme using the theme switcher widget
3. Confirm that you remain on the same screen after theme change
4. Verify that navigation history is preserved (back button works as expected)

## Future Considerations

This fix establishes a pattern for any app-level state that should not trigger navigation resets. Other providers that might cause similar issues should also use `ref.read()` instead of `ref.watch()` when accessing router configuration.
